# Project-Ideas

## HI THERE!!!... :) ##
**What is this repo about?**
We hope this repo can be a scratch pad for anyone to throw in ideas for a data science project that pydatalagos community can work on.

**What kind of ideas?**
Ideas that helps solve a societal problem through data analytics. our aim with is to to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems.
No ideas is too vague... so lets them out!   

**How do I add a idea**
There are some really good tools on github, including a feature called [*Issues*](https://github.com/pydatalagos/project-idea/issues). This is where we can brainstorm on ideas and flesh it into projects for collaborators to work on together. 
[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) work just like any other commenting system on the Internet. 
To contribute and idea:

 - First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join). Then you have two options:
 - Comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue") Scroll through the      
   [issues list](https://github.com/pydatalagos/project-ideas/issues)
   first to see if anyone's already thinking the same way! If you see an
   idea that catches your eye, click on it, read the discussion, and
   then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread.
 - Or, create a new idea: If you don't see the idea you have in mind,
   [add a new one](https://github.com/pydatalagos/project-ideas/issues/new). You'll need a title and description. Someone from the Pydata Lagos Team will respond ASAP.

*Here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4) on using Github Issues for discussion.* 

**What happens after i share an ideas?**
Members of the community will comment and brain storm on it. And based on how popular and possible the ideas is we choose it as part of our top 3 project to work on, create a new repo for it assign a project co-coordinator among us and start working on it...
